    "description":"Myrcene, also known as alpha-Myrcene and beta-Myrcene, is a monoterpene commonly found in lemongrass, hop (Humulus Lupulus), mango, verbena, bay leaves, and thyme, among others. It is the most abundant terpene in cannabis. According to a study conducted by the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology and Agriculture, Myrcene contains 65% of the terpene content in a cannabis plant (Mediavilla & Steinemann, 1997). It is described as herbal or earthy and is commonly used as an intermediate by the fragrance industry to produce derivative terpenes. It is also acknowledged as a potent muscle relaxant, anti-inflammatory, pain reliever, and sedative. In the case of cannabinoids, Myrcene is believed to increase the speed of action, and the desired effects can be felt faster."
